Overview
This project implements a YOLO-based deep CNN model for real-time traffic sign detection and classification. The system achieves high accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.
Key Features

Real-time detection and classification of traffic signs
High precision 
Support for different traffic sign classes
Efficient single-pass detection using YOLO architecture

Dataset
The dataset consists of 4,969 samples with the following classes:

Traffic Lights (Green and Red)
Speed Limits (10 to 120 km/h in intervals of 10)
Stop Signs

All images are standardized to 640x640 pixels resolution.
